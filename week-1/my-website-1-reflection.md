Describe what open source means.
*Open source is software is accessible to everyone as well as has its source code available to everyone. Others can use the code as they please for derived works and also this guide says it shouldn't discriminate against persons, groups, or types of endeavors.

*What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
It seems like it's pretty cool. It seems like a cool way to make software free

*Assess the importance of using licenses.
Copyright is automatic in the US so it's an important way to give people access to software without them having to fear a lawsuit.
