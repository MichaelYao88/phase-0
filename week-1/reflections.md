## New Repo
Creating a new repo is as easy as going to the '+" sign in the top right of the github page (after you've logged in) and selecting "New repository".

To fork a repo you must go to that repo's page on github and select "Fork" at the top right. Then select which account you would like to fork the repository under it. You would fork a repository if you want to take already existing code and work on your own version of it. Forking also helps link it to the original repo in the github page.

To clone a repo you must open your cmd prompt, change to the directory that you would like to clone the repo into, retrieve the https url from the repository page (near the center) and type "git clone <url here>"

github was easy to set up as any other online account but git was a little more challenging as I had to use the command prompt, something new to me. Still, the instructions were straightforward, though the first time I tried to set it up I did not have administrator powers on the command prompt
