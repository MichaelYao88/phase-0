  <h1>What is the deal with Git?</h1>
<h4>December 31, 2015</h4>

<h2>Git in a nutshell</h2>
  </header>
  <article>
  <p>Git originally was developed ten years ago to simply be a version control system used to track software. Fast forward to today and it is a powerful tool used by nearly everyone in software development. Git allows you to work on different "versions", or "branches", of the software independently. You at any point can look at a snapshot of the code written on any version. Once you have decided that all the code is correct you can merge some or all branches down to the master branch. You will still have the ability to back track and see previous code if a bug were to arise.</p>
  <p>Now where GitHub comes into play is the online aspect of this version control. GitHub is a remote "cloud" used to store your code to be assessed anywhere. Where GitHub really excels is the ability to collaborate among a few or many developers without messing up any source code. In GitHub you many download the source code, make your changes, and then ask someone else to merge the code with the original. You may also do this yourself but it is best practice to have someone else merge your code to ensure that it is bug free with a new set of eyes. While code is being changed and merged you may go back through previous version to see what was changed and by who.</p>
  <p>Even if you are not a Git or GitHub user, it is easy to see why it is beneficial in the development field. After getting through some of the learning phases of Git, my first week as a user, I can already see how powerful of a tool it is. I look forward to collaborating with you all soon.</p>

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	still pretty new to this, so none of them haha (aside from the ones in older versions like body, head, p, etc.)

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	pretty much top to bottom!

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
that you can enter something and hit tab for snippets. Snippets are pretty cool, I'll likely look some up or create some if I find myself doing something over and over like in css (colors, fonts, etc)
