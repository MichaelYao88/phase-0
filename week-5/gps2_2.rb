#Reflection:
#What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
#most interesting was the logic: I had fun making the minimum number of groups. that was also the most difficult
#Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
#probably?
#Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
#I think it was, I coulda made it for a variable number of groups
#What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
#array, is ez to print and the groups are just numbers rather than names
#What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
#mostly syntax stuff. I learned "shift" and "shuffle"

#divide everyone except mod 5 into groups of 5 except for the last 16,17,18,or 19 into 4+4+4+4,4+4+4+5,4+4+5+5,5+5+5+4
#write first array of arrays using creating 1,2,3 or 4 groups of 4 deleting elements as we go
#write second array of arrays using the remainder deleting elements as we go
